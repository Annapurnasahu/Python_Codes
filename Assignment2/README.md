## Task: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description:
The program asks the user to enter a number.  
It then checks if the number is divisible by 2.  
If it is divisible by 2, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

---

## Code Explanation

### Steps:
1. Take a number as input from the user using the `input()` function.  
2. Convert the input value to an integer using `int()`.  
3. Use the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder when dividing the number by 2.  
4. If the remainder is 0, print "The number is Even."  
5. Otherwise, print "The number is Odd."

## Example Output
Enter a number: 8
The number is Even.

Enter a number: 5
The number is Odd.

# TASK 2
# Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

Author: Annapurna Sahu  

This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

## Task: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description:
The program uses a `for` loop to add numbers from 1 to 50.  
It keeps a running total and displays the final sum at the end.

---

## Code Explanation

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `total` with 0.  
2. Use a `for` loop with `range(1, 51)` to go through numbers from 1 to 50.  
3. Add each number to the variable `total`.  
4. After the loop ends, print the total sum.
