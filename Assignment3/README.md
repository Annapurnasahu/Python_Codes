## Task: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description:
The program defines a function named `factorial()` that takes a number as an argument and returns its factorial.  
It uses a `for` loop to multiply all numbers from 1 to the given number.  
Finally, it displays the factorial of the entered number.

## Code Explanation

### Steps:
1. Define a function `factorial(n)` that:
   - Initializes a variable `result` as 1.  
   - Uses a `for` loop to multiply all integers from 1 to `n`.  
   - Returns the final result.
2. Take an integer input from the user.  
3. Call the `factorial()` function with the user input.  
4. Display the factorial value.

## Example Output
Enter a number to find its factorial: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

# TASK 2

# Calculate Square Root, Log, and Sine

Author: Annapurna Sahu  

This Python program uses the **math** module to calculate the square root, logarithm, and sine of a number entered by the user.

## Task: Calculate Square Root, Log, and Sine

### Description:
The program takes a number as input and performs three mathematical operations using the built-in `math` module:
- Calculates the **square root** using `math.sqrt()`
- Calculates the **natural logarithm** using `math.log()`
- Calculates the **sine value** using `math.sin()`

It then displays all the results clearly.

## Code Explanation

### Steps:
1. Import the `math` module to use mathematical functions.  
2. Take a floating-point number as input from the user.  
3. Use:
   - `math.sqrt(num)` to find the square root.  
   - `math.log(num)` to find the logarithm.  
   - `math.sin(num)` to find the sine value.  
4. Print all the results with proper labels.

## Example Output

Enter a number: 9
Square root: 9.0 is: 3.0
Logarithm: 9.0 is: 2.1972245773362196
Sine: 9.0 is: 0.4121184852417566
